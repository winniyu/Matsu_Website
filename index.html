                <img src="image/mazu.png" alt="main matsu">
                <p> Matsu is a deity in Chinese folk belief, also known as Tianfei, Tianhou, Tianhou Shengmu, and Niangma. 
                    Throughout the ages, shipbuilders, sailors, travelers, merchants, and fishermen have all worshiped Matsu 
                    because in ancient times, sea voyages were often subject to attacks by winds and waves, and incidents of ships sinking 
                    and lives being lost were common. In order to ensure the safety of the crew, they placed their hopes in the blessings of the deity.
                    Therefore, they erected statues of Matsu and, before setting sail, would first offer sacrifices to Tianfei, 
                    praying for a safe and favorable journey. Matsu shrines would also be established on board ships for worship. 
                    Matsu belief is a highly distinctive folk belief within Chinese society.

She helped catch pirates, and saved people from devastating plagues, dreadful floods, and treacherous droughts.

                        <p>In the Yuan Dynasty and Ming Dynasty, Matsu again blessed human kind with many miracles. For her service, Matsu was recognized and appointed to “Tian Fei” (Heaven Goddess Princess).</p>
                        <p>During the Qing Dynasty, in the 23rd year of rule under Emperor Kangxi, Matsu was recognized and appointed to “Heaven Goddess Queen” and the edict of the National Spring and Autumn Worship. After that, the subsequent emperors of the Qing Dynasty recognized her thirteen additional times, which made Matsu the god with the longest title.</p>
                        <p>With the last appointment made by the Qing Dynasty Emperor Xianfeng, this title is a total of  <a href="html/title.html"> 62 words</a>.</p>

                        <p>In one version it is said that in the 19th year under the rule of Emperor Kangxi, the Governor of Fujian and Zhejiang, Yao Qishen, wrote to the Emperor "Matsu made this island peaceful with her super natural powers. Please do anything you can to officially recognize her.” Trusting the Governor's personal opinion, Emperor Kangxi then recognized and appointed Matsu as "The God Mother of the Heaven".

                        <p>In another version it is said that Matsu's name, "The God Mother of the Heaven" was appointed during the Ming Dynasty by Emperor Chongzhen. She was given the short name of angel of the holy spirit of "Bixia Yuan Jun" .
